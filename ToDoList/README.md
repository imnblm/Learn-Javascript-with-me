The **Document Object Model** *(DOM)* is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page. 

A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. In both cases, it is the same document but the DOM representation allows it to be manipulated. As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

The DOM is not part of Js, but is instead a Web API used to build websites. JavaScript can also be used in other contexts.
