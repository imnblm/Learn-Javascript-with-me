### 1. The HTML DOM Document Object : 
#### What's the DOM ?
> The **Document Object Model** *(DOM)* is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. In both cases, it is the same document but the DOM representation allows it to be manipulated. As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

The `document` object represents your web page. If you want to access any element in an HTLM page, you always start with accessing the document object. 
* `.createElement()` : create any html element
* `.classList()` : add a class to any element
* `.innerText()`
* `.innerHTML()`
* `.appendChild()`
