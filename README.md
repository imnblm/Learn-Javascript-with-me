# Let's learn Javascript together, shall we ?
> This repository is all about my learning journey to Javascript by the time I'm growing into the Js community. 

## Introduction 
> To me, the most effective way to learn any language is to build projects. 
> First of all, I teach myself the fundamentals, the syntax, etc. using any resources until I feel comfortable enough to start building projects. 

In this repository, you'll fine a bunch of small projects from beginner to advanced level. Each folder contain a project with a `README` file attached to it, summing-up each concepts I covered during the project. 

## The fundamentals
> This chapter gather all the projects I've made to consolidate what I've learn using different resources.
